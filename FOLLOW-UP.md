# Implementation:

### Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?
I didn't add any libraries - I used vanilla react with functional components (and SCSS)!

### Q) What's the command to start the application locally?

(Default) `npm start` I didn't change anything, did it all vanilla react

# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
Would have tidied up the CSS slightly and made it work for all screen sizes however would like to work on a more fully integrated solution with more features i.e. filtering

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
I'm pretty happy with the UI, I've matched it to the design to a tee (I think!) and happy that I've done it in such a way that components are reused wherever possible

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
Spent the most time on the CSS - trying to get things to align correctly as per the designs

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.
Test was quite enjoyable, well thought out and executed. I think perhaps it could be slightly clearer as to what is wanted and perhaps using a better system (i.e. Hired Assessment) as I didn't seem to be able to get it working.
